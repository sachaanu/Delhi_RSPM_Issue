Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) / (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter < 2.5 micrometers) RSPM 2.5 Problem & Predicting the peak using POC on ARIMA/FbProphet

* Introduction to the Phenomenon
Problem: Every year there is horrible air quality in Delhi around Nov-Dec, which contributes to the numerous road accidents due to low visiblity and creates a health hazard for an already polluted city.
RSPM - Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter with size 2.5 micrometers and lower is the main culprit.
There are varied reasons for this phenomenon e.g.:
Setting of winter-cold air in the lower atmosphere creates a thick blanket which traps pollution.
Farmers burning left-over crops in-around the same time, adding soot and other particulate matters.
General pollution from chemicals used in fireworks(this was a huge debate point and Supreme Court of India banned fireworks celebration on Diwali in 2018 - but still the AQI was below breathable and there was no improvement)
Albeit, there are compunding effects from various sources contributing to the detoriation of Air Quality Index of Delhi. Below news links de-lineate the scope of the problem.
